made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

![image](https://github.com/Choi-JaeHyeok-21500749/1976_LetsGoTrip/blob/main/1967_pro.PNG)

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , union-find

## What was the key point and the hard part?

We have to check current location is connected to next location.

This means checking two nodes are connected will work in this problem.

Union-find is good way to find connected city.

So, _find(current) != _find(next)

will check two cities are connected.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
